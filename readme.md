# Snake Online Prototype

This project builds on a previous project called Snake gaming campus. The objective is to take the game of Snake and try to make it online somehow.

This is a work in progress.

# TODO

Before sending instruction, have the client and server identify with a key? Use [concurrent dictionnary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.concurrent.concurrentdictionary-2?view=net-9.0) maybe to handle all the player connections.

Have the server assign a number to each of the players so that they can add the number to their message to indicate which snake to move.
